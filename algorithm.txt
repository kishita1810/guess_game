In this code, I want to create a 4 letter word guessing game or 4 digit code guessing game.
1. For this, I will need the answer stored as number or string. 
2. Second, I will need the input from the user.
3. Then I have to compare the guess made by user with the answer. 
4. If there is word or number in the correct position as the answer,
it should return x in correct position. Where x is the number of correct positions.
5. It should keep the count of attempts.
6. When the correct word or number is guessed, it should return you guessed correctly in x attempts.

Add edge cases:
1. for mode, either 1 or 2 should be added. anything else should not work
2. while guessing only 4 letter word or number should be accepted, or else it should not work
