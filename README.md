Guessing Galaxy Game is an interactive web-based guessing game where players can choose between two game modes:  
1. **Word Guessing Game**  
2. **Code Guessing Game**  

## Game Overview
In the **Word Guessing Game**, players try to guess a randomly selected four-letter word.

## Game Logic  
- Players select a game mode.  
- They input a guess (word or number) in the input field.  
- The game provides feedback on how many characters/digits are correctly placed.  
- The game continues until the correct answer is guessed.  
- The number of attempts is displayed, and past guesses are recorded for reference.  
- Once the answer is guessed, a congratulatory message appears.
